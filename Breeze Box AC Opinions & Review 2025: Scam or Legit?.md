How Does Breeze Box AC Work?
Breeze Box AC uses the principle of evaporative cooling, where hot air is drawn in through a moistened filter and expelled as cool, fresh air. Here's the process in a nutshell:
1.	Fill the water tank with cold water or ice.
2.	Turn on the unit and select your desired settings.
3.	Hot air passes through the water-saturated filter, where it is cooled and humidified.
4.	Cool air is released, instantly lowering the temperature in your immediate surroundings.
Unlike refrigerant-based ACs, this method does not emit harmful gases, making it safe for you and the environment.
